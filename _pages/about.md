Welcome to my personal website.

I am a data scientist at the [Swiss National Bank](https://www.snb.ch/){:target="_blank"}. Much of my current work centers around forecasting and time series analysis.

Previously, I have held positions at the [University of Zurich](https://www.econ.uzh.ch/){:target="_blank"} and at [Harvard Medical School](https://hms.harvard.edu/){:target="_blank"}. 

Do you have questions or suggestions? Feel free to [write me a mail](mailto: helge.liebert@gmail.com){:target="_blank"}.
