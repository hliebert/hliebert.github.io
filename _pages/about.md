Welcome to my personal website.

I am a postdoctoral fellow at the [Department of Economics](https://www.econ.uzh.ch/){:target="_blank"} and the [Jacobs Center for Productive Youth Development](https://www.jacobscenter.uzh.ch/){:target="_blank"} at the University of ZÃ¼rich. I am also affiliated with [CESifo (Munich)](http://www.cesifo-group.de/ifoHome.html){:target="_blank"}.

My research interests are in health economics, social security, labor economics and applied microeconometrics.

Do you have questions or suggestions? Feel free to [write me a mail](mailto: helge.liebert@gmail.com){:target="_blank"}.
