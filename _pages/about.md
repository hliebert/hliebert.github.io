Welcome to my personal website.

I am a postdoctoral fellow at the [Department of Health Care
Policy](https://www.hcp.med.harvard.edu/){:target="_blank"} at Harvard
University and affiliated with [CESifo
(Munich)](http://www.cesifo-group.de/ifoHome.html){:target="_blank"}.

My current research focuses on questions related to disability policy,
especially disability insurance and the education of individuals with
disabilities. More broadly, my research interests are in health/labor economics,
social security and applied microeconometrics.
