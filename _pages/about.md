Welcome to my personal website.

I am a data scientist at the [Swiss National Bank](https://www.snb.ch/), primarily working on forecasting problems.

Previously I was a postdoctoral fellow at the [Department of Economics](https://www.econ.uzh.ch/){:target="_blank"} and the [Jacobs Center for Productive Youth Development](https://www.jacobscenter.uzh.ch/){:target="_blank"} at the University of ZÃ¼rich. I am also a research fellow at the [Institute for Labor Economics (IZA)](https://www.iza.org){:target="_blank"} and affiliated with [CESifo](http://www.cesifo-group.de/ifoHome.html){:target="_blank"}.

Do you have questions or suggestions? Feel free to [write me a mail](mailto: helge.liebert@gmail.com){:target="_blank"}.
