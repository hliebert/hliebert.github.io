# My website

The site is based on the [minimal
mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) Jekyll theme and partly
inspired by the [academicpages](https://academicpages.github.io/) layout.

Since Github pages does not support Jekyll plugins, the site requires a manual
build of the `develop` branch and publishing `_site` on `master`. The process is
automated using `rake`.
